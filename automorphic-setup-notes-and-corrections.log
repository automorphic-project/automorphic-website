In "README", "conf.ini" should be "config.ini".

In "rules" file, the mentioned "scripts/fix_titles_refs.py" does not exist. The only file with that name is in "/automorphic-tools/checks". (That's where the files listing the chapters are mentioned.)

Same for "scripts/functions.py" (this file exists, but the chapter names are in the file by the same name in "/automorphic-tools/checks").

What is the rule to create tags/tags?


To do: replace "automorphic" from files under "scripts", Makefiles, documentation (later), any mention of "automorphic.png", "automorphic.ico", "automorphic.project@gmail.com", automorphic with github, "automorphic.math.columbia.edu", "automorphic.sqlite", references in config.ini

Remove slogangenerator
